Disclaimer:
First of all, I am not responisble for what you do with this and do not use it for malicous purposes.
I fixed the decomp for pt modders to use and create mods for pt using a more fixed decomp. 
If you use this for malicous intent, then you should not be using this decomp.
Second, Please note that This is NOT my decomp, Calaminster made it, with Zhakich
Providing the decomp to me and several others, the thing was with this decomp is it just suffered a ton
of index issues like sprites, sounds and object indexes that made it really hard to work with, if you
dont know what any of that means, just know that it means its hell to use the decomp with broken indexes,
so I went ahead and did the fixing process for you all. I also went ahead and got all the levels 
tiled too (includes the 3 main levels and pizzascare with all secrets included)
Now with that out of the way, Less focusing on fixing, more focusing on your mods.- Luigio

oh btw if you didnt want to read any of that stuff above then heres your TLDR:
fixed an xmas break decomp made by Calaminster for you all, have fun
